# tervid

watch videos from your terminal

# dependencies
- [tiv](https://github.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer)
- [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv)

# notes
- the .images folder gets really messy so you should delete it after every use if you haven't watched the whole video and stopped it yourself, or else it clears itself at the end of the script.
